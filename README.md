# RECAS
This is a project for our PLTW curriculum. This repo is currently **under construction**

RECAS (Rear-End Collision Alert System) is a device designed to be a do-it-yourself solution to a drought of aftermarket collision alert systems. The only current systems are for commercial uses, or are installed by defauly in newer cars. The RECAS is designed to bridge this gap.

It is currently a work-in-progress, and thus, this repository is under construction.

The RECAS uses a LiDAR ToF sensor, a GPS sensor, and a microcontroller to calculate a safe following distance, determine the difference between the safe distance and the actual following distance, and alert the user accordingly via an LCD display and a buzzer.
